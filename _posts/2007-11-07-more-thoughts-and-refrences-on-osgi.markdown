After seeing the Costin Leau's presentation, get a bit more familiar with the OSGI, as Costin said, OSGI primarily tries to approach following problem:  
  
1. System Modularity. (visibility)  
2. Versioning.  
3. (Operational Control) Dynamic loading/unloading.  
  
The most hard part of it would be:  
  
1. Declarative Service Registry. In other words, it is about beans (service) collaboration.  
2. Build Bundle Repository. I know it is not so hard as the first one, but it takes time to convert all the existed jars to bundle...
