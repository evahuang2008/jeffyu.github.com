My ex company [IONA](http://www.iona.com/) just closed down the Beijing R&D center in January 2008. You can see this news from [this link.](http://ie.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/jmxw/200802/20080205367694.html)

IONA has an open source division, which is consist of couple people, which has been acquired from the Logicblaze.  They are mostly invovled in Apache Servicemix, ActiveMQ, Geronimo. and they are all working from home.

But in china, I still haven't seen any people that is working from home, and I remembered couple years ago, it seems it is quite often that you can work from home oversea. Right now, I am joining in the [Redhat Beijing R&D](http://www.redhat.com/) [JBoss](http://www.jboss.org/) division, although I am still in probation period, but I would still want to say that "We are able to work from home here", although it is just 1-2 days per weeek, but this is AWESOME already!!! This is a great improvement, I would say that this phenomenon will become more and more common in china in the future, i am looking forward to that day.
