After seeing the Costin Leau's presentation, get a bit more familiar with the OSGI, as Costin said, OSGI primarily tries to approach following problem:<br /><br />1. System Modularity. (visibility)<br />2. Versioning.<br />3. (Operational Control) Dynamic loading/unloading.<br /><br />The most hard part of it would be:<br /><br />1. Declarative Service Registry. In other words, it is about beans (service) collaboration.<br />2. Build Bundle Repository. I know it is not so hard as the first one, but it takes time to convert all the existed jars to bundle...<br /><br /><br />Reference<br />1. <a href="http://www.parleys.com/display/PARLEYS/Spring%20OSGi">Costin Leau's Spring-OSGI presentation</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/osgi-adrian-colyer">Adrian Coyler's interview at InfoQ</a>
