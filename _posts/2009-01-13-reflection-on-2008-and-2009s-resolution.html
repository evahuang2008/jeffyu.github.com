I know it is a bit late for the new year resolution, but you probably know that I am kind of guy that is always behind than others. ;-)<br /><br />So, before I am looking forward 2009, let me just think it back on what I have done on 2008. The first big thing of it is that I got an opportunity to join in JBoss division, Redhat.<br /><br />Then, here are things:<br /><ol><li>Used the Fedora Linux as my day to day OS. I used Ubuntu distro on the next half year of 2007.</li><li>Learned that <a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/platforms/soa">JBoss SOA-P</a> product, initially, learning the J<a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossesb">Boss ESB</a>, and then write a simple <a href="http://people.apache.org/%7Ejeffyu/articles/zh_CN/jbossesb/">JBoss ESB introduction article in chinese</a>.</li><li>Worked on a sub-project of <a href="http://www.jboss.org/overlord">JBoss Overlord</a>, its called <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-cdl-10/">CDL(process governance)</a>, and <a href="http://www.jboss.com/index.html?module=bb&amp;op=viewtopic&amp;p=4192082">released our first Milestone in Nov 2008</a>.</li><li>Learned the security stuff, and then have some work on security integration with opensso in JBoss SOA-P product.</li><li>Me, Howard and Young set up a new project on the google code, its called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/twiddling">Twiddling</a>, yeah, we are trying to get it as a next generation of current JBoss AS's twiddle. and we are working on it in our spare time.<br /></li></ol>I have to say that I learn a lot since I joined in the JBoss, it is quite extensive as well. Say, not just ESB, but also BPM, BPEL, identity, security and so on. It makes me quite busy.<br /><br />Well, for the 2009, I am thinking that I am gonna try following things.<br /><ol><li>Learn a new languague, could be either erlang, scala or ruby? Apparently, ruby is very hooot these years. I am apt to erlang or scala. but we will see. I am thinking I am too Java centric, need to learn a new language, so that might look java in a new fresh perspective.</li><li>Continuing to work on/focus on ESB, BPM, Governance etc, say in the SOA area. But as the REST is easy to use compared to the web service, I would expect more and more peole are building RESTful service. I just hate to read the wsdl, bepl file. Frankly, IMHO, the wsdl and bepl were not desinged for human read. The xml was not a programming language, so if it is too large, it is out of our reading capability. </li><li>Get our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/twiddling">Twiddling</a> project out of door, hopefully in first half year of 2009. </li><li>Write more articles on SOA, or even JBoss AS area.</li></ol>Well, I would expect that 2009 will still be a bad econimo year in world wide, but with above things in mind, I still think it should be fun.<br /><br />Lets go for 2009. ;-)
