I guess this is most useful for chinese people, since most of us are having QQ.
So in case the Pidgin has troubles in logging in QQ, which as same as I have right now. Two other stuff that you could have a go.
1. install Eva software:
sudo apt-get install eva

if you can't input Chinese, open a chat dialog, right click, choose the scim. Details please see [Install Eva in ubuntu](http://www.agou.com/?action=show&id=14)

2. Using web based tool, such as http://www-t1.meebo.com.cn/index.html.

The Eva software has a bit trouble in accepting files which I test today, but chat is ok, I guess if you do want to receive a file in the ubuntu, then other IM might be a good choice for you to do that.
