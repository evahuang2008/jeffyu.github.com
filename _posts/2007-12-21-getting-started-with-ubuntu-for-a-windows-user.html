After played with ubuntu about a month, it is time to write an entry about alternative softwares from Windows.
1. Mail: use thunderbird mail client. If you use the Gmail client, that is ok.
2. Chinese input: use the SCIM, but make sure you are using the scim-bridge, otherwise, the scim is conflict with Opera, skype and so on.
3. Text Editor: gedit, vim, Emacs. vi for updating some config file is very handy, I like X-emacs, and is learning it now. try to use Emacs to replace the gedit.
4. IM client: use the Pidgin, it supports QQ, MSN, Yahoo &amp; AIM.
5. Browser: Firefox, Opera, but for myself, use firefox most of time.
6. Notes: Tomboy Notes, this little software is very handy, it helps you make note very easy, and it can export the content to a HTML page, which contains all of notes in a page with some anchors.
7. PDF reader: kpdf
8. CHM reader: xchm.
9. office: open office.
10. Install samba to access the window's shared files or printers.
11. Install vsftpd to create a ftp server.
12. Use eclipse for java coding.

That is what I used so far, it works perfect.
