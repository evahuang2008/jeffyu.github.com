Today, I conduct a 'JBI in a nutshell' in our Beijing team, because we are trying to think how to make <a href="http://jboss.org/jbossesb">JBossESB</a> SCA compatible. But before introduction of SCA, I'd like to share JBI spec to our team from my experience when I was working on <a href="http://servicemix.apache.org/">ServiceMix</a>. So here come the <a href="http://jeff.yuchang.googlepages.com/JBI_Presentation.pdf">'JBI in a nutshell' ppt</a> that I used today.<br /><br />Hopefully you will find it offers a little help for you understanding JBI, <a href="http://servicemix.apache.org/">ServiceMix</a>, and <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossesb">JBossESB</a>.
