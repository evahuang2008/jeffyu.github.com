I got my new laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad T61p) on Tuesday, after I removed the Windows Vista(It is god damn hard to use compare to Windows XP), and installed the Fedora 8. currently, it works like a charm, and I found I like it very much, with the nvidia drivers up (with 3D support), the appearance looks great compare to the one that I install it in my office PC.

After played in the T61P, I found the feelings on its keyboard is much better than in the Dell D820, it makes you want to code as much as possible. ;-), I know, a lot of people are fond of the Lenovo (ex IBM) Laptop keyboard, just haven't got a chance to use it myself..

So, I would not consider to buy next laptop from Dell again...maybe will stick to the ThinkPad series, or Apple as my alternative..:)
