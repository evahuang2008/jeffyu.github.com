Have worked on the web service area since when I joined the IONA in 2007, specifically, from the time that I started working on the <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/">Apache CXF project</a>. Although I've been working on web service stuff about 3 years, I still thought it is not an easy job to code against web service. these days, some of my friends ask me about the web service, from concepts to its hello-world example. So I think it worths to do a blog entry for people to get started with web service projects.<br /><br />And then I remembered that <a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/">Glen</a> has did a ton of great blog entries about web service stack.(CXF, Metro and even Aix2 lately), and all of them are very detail, step-to-step. So here we go, we pick some of Glen's blog entries to get you started on web service.<br /><br />It is better that you get some concepts like the WSDL, SOAP, XSD, and read the JAXWS spec if time is allowed, just get a rough idea on it is ok, before we code against web service.<br /><br />Firstly, let's see the<a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/creating_a_wsdl_first_web1"> Creating a WSDL-first web service with Apache CXF or GlassFish Metro</a> entry, it is our 'hello world' example.<br /><br />Want to see the SOAP Message that was transferred on the wire? you have couple options for this. One is to use tools like <a href="http://wso2.org/blog/saliya/3938">Apache TCP Monitor</a> or <a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/wireshark_usage_for_cxf">wireshark</a>. Another option is to use the JAXWS handler(similar to interceptor) mechanism, which is a very important feature in the spec. See <a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/adding_jax_ws_handlers_to">Glen's JAX-WS handler blog entry</a> to try it out.<br /><br />So you saw the soap message on the wire, how can we do with the binary stuff, that is what MTOM is for, you can see <a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/using_mtom_and_apache_fop">"Returning PDFs from Web Services using MTOM and Apache FOP" blog entry</a> for its usage and detail.<br /><br />If you are a person who like the Test-Driven Development, then don't miss the '<a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/writing_junit_test_cases_for">creating junit test case for web service</a>' blog entry.<br /><br />Security is a big concern in the enterprise development, so that is what ws-security spec for. firstly, you could read the '<a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/setting_up_ssl_and_basic">Using SSL and Basic Authentication with web services (Tomcat or WebLogic)</a>' for its basic usage, and then go on reading the <a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/implementing_ws_security_using_usernametokens">username token profile blog entry</a>, <a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/implementing_ws_security_with_pki">Implementing WS-Security with public key certificates for Metro-based web services</a>. Also can read the ' <a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/using_the_opensaml_library_in">Using OpenSAML in JAX-WS Handlers</a>' if you are interested in the SAML token profile in ws-security.<br /><br />I think that should be enough for you to get it started, you can explore more on the <a href="http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/">Glen's website</a>, you would find more entries about web service.
