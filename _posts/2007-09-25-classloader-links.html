Recently, I am working on implementing the JCA stuff, one thing is very important for me is about the ClassLoader. ClassLoader becomes more and more important as now we got a lot of middle-ware stuff. You know, software has the version, a specific software can have multiple version as time goes by, so different middle-ware software might use different jar version, it may caused something incompatible due to different version.(such as API changes etc).<br /><br />1. <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/class-loader-howto.html">Tomcat ClassLoader explained.</a><br />2. <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/standards/index.html">JDK endorsed standards override mechanism.</a><br />3. <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/extensions/spec.html">Extension Mechanism Architecuture</a><br />4. <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=ClassLoading">Understanding J2EE Application Server Class Loading Architectures</a><br />5. <a href="http://www.onjava.com/lpt/a/onjava/2001/06/26/ejb.html">EJB 2 and J2EE Packaging</a>
