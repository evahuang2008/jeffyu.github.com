The reasons that why I am switching blog from MSN space to bloggers are:  
1. MSN space doesn't have the label concept, it just has the folder, and a particular blog can only belong to the one folder, which is depressed me mostly.  
2. It is so hard to make it beautiful in writing some blogs with Code. I am thinking that MSN space target users are not for programmers like me.  
3. MSN space layout and the template is ugly.  
4. Accessing to the MSN space is kind of slow.  
  
So I decided to reactive my blogger account, and I will blog the IT stuff here by using my poor english. ;-)
