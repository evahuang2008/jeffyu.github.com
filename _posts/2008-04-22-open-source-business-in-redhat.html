As I said earlier, I've joined in the Redhat JBoss Divsion after IONA closed down the Beijing R&amp;D. In the Redhat, it is a bit different from what I used to know about open source business.

Redhat now has two open source distribution. One is <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>, the other is RedHat Enterprise Linux, (RHEL for short).

Actually, Fedora is a community distribution, which means it is not only developed by Redhatters, but in the community. and it releases twice a year, you can free to download the fedora and use it without any charges.

In the other hand, the RHEL is distributed by Redhat Corp, its packages, softwares are from the Fedora selectively, it is well tested by redhatters, it just release once in two years. The main object for RHEL is the stable. If you need to use the RHEL, then you need to pay the subscribe fee to Redhat.

So, this is how Redhat runs the Operating System. After Redhat acquired the JBoss, now we run the JBoss Open Source similiar to what we do in the OS.

We have <a href="http://www.jboss.org">jboss.org</a> and <a href="www.jboss.com">jboss.com</a> two websites, which the jboss.org is a community version, it releases more often in the jboss.org. whereas we only release 1 or 2 times each year for the jboss.com.
we also guarantee that the jboss.com distribution is well-tested, more stable than the community one.

I think this solution makes sense, in the community one, we are after cutting edge technology, most advance ideas and so on, but in the company one, we are also using cutting-edge technology, but we primarily focus on its stable for enterprise use.
