<div id="msgcns!4001C604AF3F011!408" class="bvMsg">
<div>My name is Jeff, I am a software developer, I've been working at Achievo for one and half years.</div>
<div>My job is reviewing requirements, writing Design Documents, writing codes and delivering good quality products.
Achievo has good environment, very good enterprise culture and a lof of spaces where I can develop not only in my professional skillset but also in english and other fields such as, playing PingPong, playing foosball and so on, that is why I worked at achievo.
The first impressive thing for me is the birthday party, you know, I didn't hold any offical birthday party before. In achievo, they hold birthday party every month, they also send out the birthday postcards and gifts to birth stars. That makes me feel that I am a member of achievo family rather than a staff of achievo company.
Although achievo did not have a long history, but I think It is a fast-growing, good environment, very good enterprise culture company, moreover, there are a bunch of nice people here.</div>
<div>In a word, achievo is an excellent company, I am so glad that I have the opportunity to work here.&nbsp;

----It is just a draft forÂ  company's video shooting, hope it does not make you vomitive. ;-).
