Since I worked in SOA area, haven't touched the database for couple years, although in some projects, I need to test against various database (Mysql, Postgres, Oracle etc), but it is very basic stuff, like create database, users etc.

This post basically is a memo for me, I need to work with various DBs from time to time, and think it is best to record it in my blog, instead of looking into the manual again. ;-). Also, you could see this is a follow-up post for my previous <a href="http://jeff.familyyu.net/2008/05/postgresql-installationconnection-in.html">postgres installation blog</a>.

1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Postgres</strong></span>

1) connect Postgres
<blockquote>psql -h localhost -U postgres&nbsp;</blockquote>
2) add user
<blockquote>create user jeff with password 'jeff'&nbsp;</blockquote>
3) create database
<blockquote>create database jeffdb&nbsp;</blockquote>
4) grant db to user
<blockquote>grant all privileges on database jeffdb to jeff&nbsp;</blockquote>
Log out with "q" command

Log in jeffdb through user jeff:
<blockquote>psql -d jeffdb -U jeff&nbsp;</blockquote>
2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mysql</strong></span>

1) connect mysql
<blockquote>mysql -u root -p 'urpassword'&nbsp;</blockquote>
2) create database
<blockquote>create database jeffdb&nbsp;</blockquote>
3) allow user jeff to connect to the server from localhost using the password jeff
<blockquote>grant usage on *.* to jeff@localhost identified by 'jeff';&nbsp;</blockquote>
4)grant all privileges on the jeffdb database to this user
<blockquote>grant all privileges on jeffdb.* to jeff@localhost ;&nbsp;</blockquote>
Log out and log in through jeff user.
<blockquote>mysql -u jeff -p'jeff' jeffdb&nbsp;</blockquote>
