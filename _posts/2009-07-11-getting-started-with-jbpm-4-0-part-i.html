<a href="http://processdevelopments.blogspot.com/2009/07/jbpm-40-is-out.html">jBPM 4.0 was out</a> yesterday, so I played it with a simple example, also include installing the eclipse plugin, and see the jbpm console, which I haven't tried them out before, to get a feeling about them. Below are the steps that I did, hopefully you find it helpful for you to get started.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Install jBPM and JBoss</span>

1. Download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jbpm/files/a%29%20jBPM%204/jbpm-4.0.zip/download">jbpm 4.0 distribution</a>.
2. Extract it into your local directory, here mine is: /local/deploy
3. Go to jbpm-4.0/jboss.
4. Added the build.properties into ${user.home}/.jbpm4 directory if you want to update the default properties in the ant script. (below is what I did, I used the jboss-5.0.1.GA, and I already had the zip ball in the /local/softwares directory)
<pre>database=hsqldbjboss.version=5.0.1.GAjbpm.parent.dir=/local/deployjboss.distro.dir=/local/softwares</pre>
You can refer to <a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/jBPM4BuildingfromSource">this wiki entry</a> for detail.
5. run following command to install jboss &amp; jbpm.
<pre>ant install.jbossant install.jbpm.into.jboss</pre>
Now, you go to the jbpm-4.0/jboss-5.0.1.GA, run:
bin/run.sh -c default.

It should start the jbpm server properly, later then we need to populate the schema &amp; initialized sqls.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Import jBPM db schema and identity sql</span>

1. Go to jBPM-4.0/db, run following command to populate the schema &amp; sql.
<pre>ant create.jbpm.schemaant load.example.identities</pre>
Now, you can go to http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console, use the 'alex/password' as the username and password combination, you should be able to log in the jbpm console.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Install the jBPM eclipse plugin</span>

I won't described the steps for its installation, as it was very well documented in the <a href="http://docs.jboss.com/jbpm/v4.0/userguide/html_single/#graphicalprocessdesigner">user guide</a>.
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Note, it was based on the eclipse 3.5 jee distribution.</span>

In the next entry, we will try to build a simple process by using the Eclipse GUI.
