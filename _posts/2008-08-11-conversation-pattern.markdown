Gregor says:


> There's usually a handful of roles that are defined. And usually there's a series of message types, and that's where WSDL and XSDs can do a little bit for us, like a certain message has a certain meaning and a certain structure. So for example I buy coffee and maybe my message contains what I want and then in the case of Starbucks there are 17 optional fields for all the extra double shot; but you have some notion of what's in these messages and then you have the rules about which messages can flow in which order. And that is really the most difficult part.




> And that is exactly the sort argument between the BEPL people - they say that most of the time there is a central coordinator and this works pretty well and it's executable - and then what the choreography people say - careful here, you're making a very strong assumption, really we should look at the overall conversation there could be 20 parties and they all send messages back and forth, now we should not assume that there is this one thing that controls everything. That's exactly when the people fight and, stand up, and walk off with this kind of argument.


To the point. ;-), Hope you enjoy all the interview from [Gregor Hohpe](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/gregor-hohpe-conversations)
