Noticed from <a href="http://markclittle.blogspot.com/2009/03/analyze-your-blog.html">Mark's Blog</a>, I've analysed my blog, it turns out <a href="http://typealyzer.com/index.php">I am a Duty Fulfiller</a>?<br /><br /><blockquote>The responsible and hardworking type. They are especially attuned to the details of life and are careful about getting the facts right. Conservative by nature they are often reluctant to take any risks whatsoever.<br /><br />The Duty Fulfillers are happy to be let alone and to be able to work int heir own pace. They know what they have to do and how to do it.<br /><br /></blockquote>I think I am more than a Duty Fulfiller??? Maybe it is an indication like I didn't blog often. Anyway, it is interesting. ;-)
