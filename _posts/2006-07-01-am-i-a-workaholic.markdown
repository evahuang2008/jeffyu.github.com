Am I study too hard? Am I a workaholic? I don't know, but this year's learning is the best pleased thing so far, I've never felt that I can know technology so well or can understand easily before, and I think that is why I read some many books these days.
But so what? What if I have learned all of the technology? I still have to struggle for the living, now I can't see my road of future. I always think that I am a guy who did not like the stable job, since a lot of stable jobs always linked to the boring. I like the job with passion, at least, for now. But sometimes I felt a bit tired of this, since I am awalys thinking that should I need to switch a job or are there any better positions fit meÂ  in the market....
Wow... Again, all things are about work.....
OK,Anson, stop saying that, I know what you wanna say, I know that definetly, I am trying my best to recoverying, so give me a bit more time, alright?;-)
