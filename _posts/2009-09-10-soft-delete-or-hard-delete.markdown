Read the topic of whether we should use the 'soft delete' or 'hard delete' when we are building enterprise application. It was started by [Ayende's 'Avoid soft deletes'](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/08/30/avoid-soft-deletes.aspx), and then [Udi Dahan says 'don't delete, just dont'](http://www.udidahan.com/2009/09/01/dont-delete-just-dont/). [InfoQ has a thread to discuss about it](http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/09/Do-Not-Delete-Data). Personally, I agree with Udi Dahan. I didn't say that we should always use soft delete. But I would say use it in most cases, compared to the hard delete.
