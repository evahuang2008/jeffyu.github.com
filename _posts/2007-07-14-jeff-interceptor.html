Developing frameworks that can be extended transparently.
The Interceptor architectural pattern allows services to be added transparently to a framework and triggered automatically when certain events occur.&nbsp;

[参与者和职责]
Interceptor:
* Defines an interface for integrating out-of-band services
Concrete Interceptor:
* Implements a specific out-of-band service
* Uses context object to control the concrete framework.
Dispatcher
* Allows applications to register and remove concrete interceptors.
* Dispatches registered concrete interceptor callbacks when event occur
Context Object
* Allows services to obtain information from the concrete framework
* Allows services to control certain behaviour of the concrete framework.

[实现]
这个实现分成7步.
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1. Should document the aspects that are related to interception</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">2. Identify and model interception points.</span>
1) Identify concrete framework state transitions that may not be visible to external applications, but are subject to interception.
2) Partition interception points into reader and writer sets.The reader set includes all state transitions in which applications only access information from the concrete framework. Conversely the writer set includes all state transitions in which applications can modify the behavior of the concrete framework.
3) Integrate interception points into the state machine model. Interception points can be modeled in the state machine by introducing intermediary states. If a state transition is subject to interception, place a new interception state between the source state and the sink state of the original transition. This interception state triggers the corresponding interceptors. For interception points that belong to the writer set, introduce additional state transitions in which the following properties apply:
* The interception state is the start node and
* The target nodes are states that represent the subsequent behavior of the concrete framework after the interception.
4) Partition interception points into disjoint interception groups. To process events, concrete frameworks often perform a series of related activities, each of which may be associated with an interception point. To emphasize the relationship between each activity, it may be useful to coalesce a series of semantically-related interception points into an interception group.
<span style="color: #ff0000;">3. Specify the context objects.</span>
1) Determine the number of context object types.
* Multiple interfaces.
* Single interface.
In general, multiple interfaces are useful when client applications intercept a wide variety of different framework events. In other cases, however, the single interface strategy may be preferable due to its simplicity.
2) Define how to pass context objects to concrete interceptors. Context objects are instantiated by the concrete framework. They are passed to a concrete interceptor using one of the following two strategies:
* Per-registration. In this strategy a context object is passed to an interceptor once when it registers with a dispatcher.
* Per-event. In this strategy a context object is passed to a concrete interceptor with every callback invocation.
The per-event strategy allows a concrete framework to provide finegrained information about the occurrence of a particular event. In contrast, the perregistration strategy only provides general information common to all occurrences of a particular event type. The per-event strategy may incur higher overhead, however, due to repeated creation and deletion of context objects.
<span style="color: #ff0000;">4. Specify the interceptors.</span> An interceptor defines a generic interface that a concrete framework uses to invoke concrete interceptors, via dispatchers, when interception points are triggered.
<span style="color: #ff0000;">5. Specify the dispatchers. </span>For each interceptor, define a dispatcher interface that applications can use to register and remove concrete interceptors with the concrete framework. In addition, this interface is used by the framework to dispatch concrete
interceptors registered at interception points.
1) Specify the interceptor registration interface. A dispatcher corresponds to the Observer pattern's subject role. It implements a registration interface for interceptors, which correspond to the observer role.
2) Specify the dispatcher callback interface. When an interception event occurs the concrete framework notifies its dispatcher. When notified, a dispatcher invokes the corresponding hook methods of its registered concrete interceptors. A dispatcher often provides the same interface to the concrete framework that its associated interceptor provides to the dispatcher.
<span style="color: #ff0000;">6. Implement the callback mechanisms in the concrete framework. </span>The dispatcher's internal callback mechanism can be implemented with the Iterator pattern Similarly, a dispatcher can apply the Strategy pattern to allow applications to select from among several interceptor callback orderings:
* Simple invocation strategies include 'first-in first-out' (FIFO) or 'last-in first-out' (LIFO) ordering strategies, where interceptors are invoked in the order they were registered or vice-versa. When using the Interceptor pattern to implement a particular 'interceptor stack', a combined FIFO/LIFO approach can be used to process messages traversing the stack. On the client a FIFO strategy can be used to pass messages down the stack. On the server a LIFO strategy can be used to pass messages up the stack.
*  A more sophisticated ordering callback strategy dispatches concrete interceptors in priority order. In this strategy an application passes a priority parameter when registering a concrete interceptor with a dispatcher. When propagating an event, the dispatcher invokes interceptors with higher priorities first.
*  Another sophisticated callback strategy is based on the Chain of Responsibility pattern. If a concrete interceptor can handle the event that its dispatcher delivers, it returns the corresponding result. Otherwise it can return a special value or raise an exception to indicate it is not interested in intercepting the event. In this case the callback dispatching mechanism asks the next interceptor in the chain to handle the event. This progression stops after one of the interceptors handles the event.
<span style="color: #ff0000;">7. Implement the concrete interceptors.</span>

在这个模式里,很多时候我们老是跟<a href="http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternChain.aspx">Chain Of Responsibility Design Pattern</a>混淆.这里有个重大的不同点就是: Concrete Interceptor他只负责处理信息,不负责转向(forward),forward的工作是交由Dispatcher来做. 而Chain Of Responsibilty里面,具体的Concrete Handler不但负责处理,而且还负责转向.
