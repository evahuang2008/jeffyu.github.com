Just like what I did for [my fedora roadmap](http://jeff.familyyu.net/2008/05/my-fedora8-roadmap-on-t61p.html), here comes my Mac OS X one.

1. Instant message: Adium, [http://adium.im/](http://adium.im/)
2. video chat: skype, [http://www.skype.com](http://www.skype.com/)
3. irc client, colloquy, [http://colloquy.info/](http://colloquy.info/)
4. chinese input, just use the built-in one directly, here is an post about the chinese input, and also can use the chinese language for the whole mac osx. [http://appleclinic.wordpress.com/2008/04/16/chinese-text-input/](http://appleclinic.wordpress.com/2008/04/16/chinese-text-input/)
5. firefox, In case you still like to use the firefox in your mac box, yes, it works great. [http://www.firefox.com](http://www.firefox.com/)
6. twitter client, twitterrific: [http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific)
7. QQ, this one should be very china specific, :), good news is that we do have a [Mac OS X QQ](http://im.qq.com/qq/mac/download.shtml) as beta right now.
8. QuickSilver, this is a new tool compared to what I had in both windows and linux, it makes people really easy to start application, you can download and install it from here. [http://www.blacktree.com/](http://www.blacktree.com/)
9. Textmate, this one is a lot of rubyists choice on doing ruby on rails.. [http://macromates.com/](http://macromates.com/), not free though.
10. Skitch, [http://skitch.com/](http://skitch.com/), make it easy to share screenshot etc.
11. [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), this is still my preference for java programming.
12. [Macports](http://www.macports.org/install.php), this is a utility more like Fedora's Yum, Ubuntu's apt-get.
13. [Growl](http://growl.info/), this is a great software for the notifications.
14. [dropbox](http://growl.info/), this is a pretty good software if you want to sync stuff between mac and iphone.

If you want to install JDK5 in the snow leopard, here is a good solution to this problem, [http://www.scribd.com/doc/22853741/Installing-Java-5-Back-on-Snow-Leopard](http://www.scribd.com/doc/22853741/Installing-Java-5-Back-on-Snow-Leopard), Here I'd like to thank [Kurt](http://kurtstam.blogspot.com/), strong, liweinan for making some suggestions on these softwares. ;)

At last, this is what I had, [http://skitch.com/jeffyu/dp3pm/fullscreen](http://skitch.com/jeffyu/dp3pm/fullscreen). ;)

please let me know what else you believe that I should try out.
