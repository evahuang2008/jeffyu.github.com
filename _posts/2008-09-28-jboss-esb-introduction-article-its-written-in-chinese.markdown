Just finished a writing of [JBoss ESB introduction](http://people.apache.org/%7Ejeffyu/articles/zh_CN/jbossesb/) in chinese, I think [JBoss ESB](http://www.jboss.org/jbossesb) is a good ESB implementation, and it has plenty of quick starts, which can help you get it started very quickly. And one of its strong points is that it integrates with jBPM, JBoss Rules, Smooks seamlessly. So it worths you to check it out. Hopefully my little article can help you understand it more quickly if you can read chinese. ;-)
