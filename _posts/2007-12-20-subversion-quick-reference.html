See Johnny's <a href="http://blogs.tech-recipes.com/johnny/subversion-quick-reference">this blog entry</a>. It is very useful if you don't use the GUI such as tortoise in windows.

one more note on this is that you can export SVN_EDITOR=your favorite text editor, and then when you run:
svn ci
it opens up your specified the editor to input your commit comment.
