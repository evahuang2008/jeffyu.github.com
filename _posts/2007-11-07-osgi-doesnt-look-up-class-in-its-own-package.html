Today I am trying the sample code from <a href="http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t90796.html">this article.</a>.<br /><br />Say, I am exporting one package as: com.example.movies. Then I write another bundle called FlatMovies.jar that contains a class inside com.example.movies(say package as the exported one).<br /><br />In this situation, I would get a ClassNotFoundException when I try to start the FlatMovies bundle..<br /><br />Not sure why, here make it a note.
