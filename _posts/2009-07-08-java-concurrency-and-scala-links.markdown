On the weekend, happened to read the  [《core java concurrency》](http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/core-java-concurrency?oid=hom11507) ref card, it is a great material, and good summary. Also, read the [a scala blog](http://macstrac.blogspot.com/2009/04/scala-as-long-term-replacement-for.html) entry from [James Strachan](http://macstrac.blogspot.com/). Very interesting to read, and there are a lot of scala resources links  on the blog.  
  
Hope you enjoy these two as I do.
