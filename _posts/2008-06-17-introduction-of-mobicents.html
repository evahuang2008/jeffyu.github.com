Today, my colleague <a href="http://amitbhayani.blogspot.com/">Amit</a> give the Beijing team a presentation on <a href="http://www.jboss.org/mobicents">JBoss Mobicents</a>, This project is very interesting, it is a event-based architecture. It can be deployed in the JBoss AS easily. With this project, you can easily integrate your application with telcom stuff, such as phone, SMS message etc, it also have Google talk built-in and so on. Its architecture is easily extended, if you find some protocol are missing, just feel free to implement a Resource Adapter, it is trivial.

Are you tired of doing the database-backend, typcially just database operate(CRUD), enterprise application? We all know our next big thing mostly will happen on Cellphone, don't we? Then why not take a peak at Mobicents, and give it a try?

See <a href="http://www.jbossworld.com/downloads/pdf/friday/2-25_NEW_Web_2_and_Communications_Building_Converged_Applications_Amit_Bhayani_JBoss.pdf">Amit's presentation</a> on JBossWorld this February.
