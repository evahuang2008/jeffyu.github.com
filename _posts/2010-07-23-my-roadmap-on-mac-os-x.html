Just like what I did for <a href="http://jeff.familyyu.net/2008/05/my-fedora8-roadmap-on-t61p.html">my fedora roadmap</a>, here comes my Mac OS X one.

1. Instant message: Adium, <a href="http://adium.im/">http://adium.im/</a>
2. video chat: skype, <a href="http://www.skype.com/">http://www.skype.com</a>
3. irc client, colloquy, <a href="http://colloquy.info/">http://colloquy.info/</a>
4. chinese input, just use the built-in one directly, here is an post about the chinese input, and also can use the chinese language for the whole mac osx. <a href="http://appleclinic.wordpress.com/2008/04/16/chinese-text-input/">http://appleclinic.wordpress.com/2008/04/16/chinese-text-input/</a>
5. firefox, In case you still like to use the firefox in your mac box, yes, it works great. <a href="http://www.firefox.com/">http://www.firefox.com</a>
6. twitter client, twitterrific: <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific</a>
7. QQ, this one should be very china specific, :), good news is that we do have a <a href="http://im.qq.com/qq/mac/download.shtml">Mac OS X QQ</a> as beta right now.
8. QuickSilver, this is a new tool compared to what I had in both windows and linux, it makes people really easy to start application, you can download and install it from here. <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">http://www.blacktree.com/</a>
9. Textmate, this one is a lot of rubyists choice on doing ruby on rails.. <a href="http://macromates.com/">http://macromates.com/</a>, not free though.
10. Skitch, <a href="http://skitch.com/">http://skitch.com/</a>, make it easy to share screenshot etc.
11. <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, this is still my preference for java programming.
12. <a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php">Macports</a>, this is a utility more like Fedora's Yum, Ubuntu's apt-get.
13. <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>, this is a great software for the notifications.
14. <a href="http://growl.info/">dropbox</a>, this is a pretty good software if you want to sync stuff between mac and iphone.

If you want to install JDK5 in the snow leopard, here is a good solution to this problem, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/22853741/Installing-Java-5-Back-on-Snow-Leopard">http://www.scribd.com/doc/22853741/Installing-Java-5-Back-on-Snow-Leopard</a>, Here I'd like to thank <a href="http://kurtstam.blogspot.com/">Kurt</a>, strong, liweinan for making some suggestions on these softwares. ;)

At last, this is what I had, <a href="http://skitch.com/jeffyu/dp3pm/fullscreen">http://skitch.com/jeffyu/dp3pm/fullscreen</a>. ;)

please let me know what else you believe that I should try out.
