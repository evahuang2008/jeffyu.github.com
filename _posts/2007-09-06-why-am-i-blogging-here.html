The reasons that why I am switching blog from MSN space to bloggers are:<br />1. MSN space doesn't have the label concept, it just has the folder, and a particular blog can only belong to the one folder, which is depressed me mostly.<br />2. It is so hard to make it beautiful in writing some blogs with Code. I am thinking that MSN space target users are not for programmers like me.<br />3. MSN space layout and the template is ugly.<br />4. Accessing to the MSN space is kind of slow.<br /><br />So I decided to reactive my blogger account, and I will blog the IT stuff here by using my poor english. ;-)
