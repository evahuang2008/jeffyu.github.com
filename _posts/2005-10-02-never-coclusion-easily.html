<div id="msgcns!4001C604AF3F011!245" class="bvMsg">
<div>I found myself always said the task was almost finished when someone asked me about the assignment task, while there is a lot of details or tiny things about the task, and what i have finished is the main function or function's skeleton. I often ignore the tiny thing, there is a famous book called &lt;detail determine everything&gt;, maybe I should learn something from this book. :(, Another question about myself is always see the positive aspect of the uncertain thing, and there is a proverb said "More expectation, more disappointment", So I should see the things or do the coclusion from multi aspect of the thing, and dont make the coclusion easily, do or say the thing after you think.</div>
