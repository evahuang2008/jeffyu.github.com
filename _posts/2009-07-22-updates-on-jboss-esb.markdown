The JBoss ESB team rolled out [its 4.6 release](http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&op=viewtopic&t=158696) yesterday, one of its main feature that it is introduced is to support the JBoss AS5, so go and grab it to try it out.

Also spotted that [Len](http://swqetesting.blogspot.com/) has composed three great posts on JBoss SOA-P, it applies also to the JBoss ESB.
1. [SOA Platform Gateways and Notifiers](http://jboss-soa-p.blogspot.com/2009/07/soa-platform-gateways-and-notifiers.html). This talks about the Gateway, ESB aware message, ESB non-aware message, Notifier concepts that from the JBoss ESB.
2. [When The Content knows the way](http://jboss-soa-p.blogspot.com/2009/07/when-content-knows-way-content-based.html). This talks about the JBoss ESB integrates with Drools.
3. [Hanging Together on the SOA Platform - Introduction to the ESB-jBPM integration](http://jboss-soa-p.blogspot.com/2009/06/hanging-together-on-soa-platform.html). This entry talks about the ESB and jBPM integration.

One thing that I must say is that these three entries are very well written, easy to understand. Very good work, Len. ;-)
