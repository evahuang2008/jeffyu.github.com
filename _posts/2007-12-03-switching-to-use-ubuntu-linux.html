Recently, I am switching to use the Ubuntu 7.10 Linux, and am working fully on this OS on daily basis. I've tried to switch to ubuntu couple months ago, it was using the Ubuntu7.04, but am back to Windows quite soon, it seems I am a bit stuck of linux, that is because I am using linux with windows' habits &amp; minds.

If you want to use the Ubuntu or other linux distro in Windows way, I'd bet you would be back to Windows at last.. If you want to use linux &amp; love it.. You will have following thoughts on your mind:

1. Like the free software very much, and try to pass it on.
2. Try to be unique.
3. To be truly tolerant. (You will encounter some softwares that do not support in the Linux, you need to be tolerant or to hack it by yourself).
4. Like to be hacking code.

The best benefit that you are using linux is that it opens everything to me, no hidings. The open spirit...
