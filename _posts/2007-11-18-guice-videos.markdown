Firstly, little background, Bob Lee's famous: [I don't get Spring](http://crazybob.org/2006/01/i-dont-get-spring.html) thread, and then he created the [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/), lightweight dependency injection.

Some Guice introduction videos from youtube. Very interesting, even if you don't want to use guice, it worths you to listen.
