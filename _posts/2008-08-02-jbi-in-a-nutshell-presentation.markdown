Today, I conduct a 'JBI in a nutshell' in our Beijing team, because we are trying to think how to make [JBossESB](http://jboss.org/jbossesb) SCA compatible. But before introduction of SCA, I'd like to share JBI spec to our team from my experience when I was working on [ServiceMix](http://servicemix.apache.org/). So here come the ['JBI in a nutshell' ppt](http://jeff.yuchang.googlepages.com/JBI_Presentation.pdf) that I used today.  
  
Hopefully you will find it offers a little help for you understanding JBI, [ServiceMix](http://servicemix.apache.org/), and [JBossESB](http://www.jboss.org/jbossesb).
