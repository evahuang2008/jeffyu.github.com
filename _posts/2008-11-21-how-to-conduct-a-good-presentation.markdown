I've listened to a lot of presentation, some of them are good, some of them are bad. I also conducted some presentation by myself. Again, some of them are bad, some of them are NOT bad. ;-).  
  
Following are some bullet points that I think are necessary to a good presentation.  
  


  1. When in doubt, leave it out, or at least, talk it quickly and not talk it too deep/much.  
(只讲自己懂的东西,如果一定要说些自己不懂的,请就简单/粗浅的说)
  2. Make sure you know the level of your target audience.  
(需要明白你的听众接受能力)
  3. Know the time for your whole presentation, do NOT extend your presentation as much as possible.  
(知道你演讲的时间,尽量不要拖长)
  4. Do NOT stay TOO LONG time in ONE slide. If it is, split it too many slides.  
(同一个演讲稿页面,别停留太长时间,如果本身内容的确需要很长时间,请把它分成几个页面)
  5. If it is an introduction presentation, then EXAMPLE is very important. Cause it can attract audience quickly.  
(如果是做一个介绍性的演讲,例子很重要)
  6. DO NOT talk too detail in your presentation, it is IMPOSSIBLE that people can know all of it just through you presentation. Highlight the important concepts and philosophy. You can lead people to documentation or other articles if they are interested.  
(别在演讲的时候讲的太细. 不要指望听众只通过听你的演讲就能知道全部东西,挑重点讲,然后告诉听众在哪儿可以看到更详细的例子)
  7. Try not to talk fast, use some easy understand words to illustrate your concepts, if it is not easy enough, it means you didn't think well how to express it or didn't understand it deeply.  
(尽量用浅显的语言去解释,如果用太深奥的语言，说明要么你没准备好,又或者你没理解透彻)
  8. If it is a product shown presentation, you'd better ask audience whether they have any questions or not in the end of each feature.  
(如果是做产品会，最好在每个特性/功能完后,问下是否有问题)
  9. Preparation is the most important. Whether is successful or not, largely depends on your preparation.  
（演讲前期的准备很关键)
What other bullet points am I missing here?
