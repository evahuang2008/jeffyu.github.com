See Johnny's [this blog entry](http://blogs.tech-recipes.com/johnny/subversion-quick-reference). It is very useful if you don't use the GUI such as tortoise in windows.

one more note on this is that you can export SVN_EDITOR=your favorite text editor, and then when you run:
svn ci
it opens up your specified the editor to input your commit comment.
