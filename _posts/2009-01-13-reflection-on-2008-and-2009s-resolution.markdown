I know it is a bit late for the new year resolution, but you probably know that I am kind of guy that is always behind than others. ;-)  
  
So, before I am looking forward 2009, let me just think it back on what I have done on 2008. The first big thing of it is that I got an opportunity to join in JBoss division, Redhat.  
  
Then, here are things:  


  1. Used the Fedora Linux as my day to day OS. I used Ubuntu distro on the next half year of 2007.
  2. Learned that [JBoss SOA-P](http://www.jboss.com/products/platforms/soa) product, initially, learning the J[Boss ESB](http://www.jboss.org/jbossesb), and then write a simple [JBoss ESB introduction article in chinese](http://people.apache.org/%7Ejeffyu/articles/zh_CN/jbossesb/).
  3. Worked on a sub-project of [JBoss Overlord](http://www.jboss.org/overlord), its called [CDL(process governance)](http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-cdl-10/), and [released our first Milestone in Nov 2008](http://www.jboss.com/index.html?module=bb&op=viewtopic&p=4192082).
  4. Learned the security stuff, and then have some work on security integration with opensso in JBoss SOA-P product.
  5. Me, Howard and Young set up a new project on the google code, its called [Twiddling](http://code.google.com/p/twiddling), yeah, we are trying to get it as a next generation of current JBoss AS's twiddle. and we are working on it in our spare time.  

I have to say that I learn a lot since I joined in the JBoss, it is quite extensive as well. Say, not just ESB, but also BPM, BPEL, identity, security and so on. It makes me quite busy.  
  
Well, for the 2009, I am thinking that I am gonna try following things.  


  1. Learn a new languague, could be either erlang, scala or ruby? Apparently, ruby is very hooot these years. I am apt to erlang or scala. but we will see. I am thinking I am too Java centric, need to learn a new language, so that might look java in a new fresh perspective.
  2. Continuing to work on/focus on ESB, BPM, Governance etc, say in the SOA area. But as the REST is easy to use compared to the web service, I would expect more and more peole are building RESTful service. I just hate to read the wsdl, bepl file. Frankly, IMHO, the wsdl and bepl were not desinged for human read. The xml was not a programming language, so if it is too large, it is out of our reading capability. 
  3. Get our [Twiddling](http://code.google.com/p/twiddling) project out of door, hopefully in first half year of 2009. 
  4. Write more articles on SOA, or even JBoss AS area.
Well, I would expect that 2009 will still be a bad econimo year in world wide, but with above things in mind, I still think it should be fun.  
  
Lets go for 2009. ;-)
