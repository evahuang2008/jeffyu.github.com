On the weekend, happened to read the  <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/core-java-concurrency?oid=hom11507">《core java concurrency》</a> ref card, it is a great material, and good summary. Also, read the <a href="http://macstrac.blogspot.com/2009/04/scala-as-long-term-replacement-for.html">a scala blog</a> entry from <a href="http://macstrac.blogspot.com/">James Strachan</a>. Very interesting to read, and there are a lot of scala resources links  on the blog.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy these two as I do.
